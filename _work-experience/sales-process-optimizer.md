Architected and implemented an automated lead generation pipeline using Python and Selenium that transformed the company's sales process. The system scraped 500+ raw leads from online listings and automatically filtered them against key criteria, saving 15+ hours of manual review time per week. This automation resulted in a 200% increase in qualified leads by organizing filtered data into structured sheets for the sales team.
