About Me
===
I'm a New Graduate at Carleton University, currently seeking work towards New Grad / Full-time roles related to Software Development, Backend, Data Analytics, or QA.

My interests lie in building solutions that have a clear and tangible impact. I'm most engaged when I'm solving complex problems that require not just writing code, but deeply understanding the 'why' behind the work. For me, the goal is to build things that are not only functional but also well-crafted and serve a genuine purpose.

Outside of coding, you can usually find me deep in a game trying to climb the ranked ladder, learning a new piano piece, or hitting the gym with my friend. Lately, I've been getting into video editing and have found it to be a great way to connect with others.

Please take a look at my portfolio to see these projects in more detail. You can also find my resume and contact information here.
